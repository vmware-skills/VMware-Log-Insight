"""Regression: the MCP instructions name the configured targets, and how to pick one.

``initialize`` hands the client the server's ``instructions``, and for a skill
whose every tool takes ``target`` that string is the only place the client learns
which targets exist. While it was static, the model called tools with no target,
got whatever ``default_target`` happened to be, and answered confidently about
the wrong system: on 2026-09-15 Monitor's default was a standalone ESXi host, so
"how many VMs does the vCenter have" was answered from that host and "no vCenter
is configured" was reported for an estate that had one. Here the stakes are the
same shape — each Log Insight server indexes its own logs, so "were there errors
last night" answers differently on each, and a silent default picks one.

Three properties, because the failure has three shapes:

* the listing is real — the names and hosts in the operator's config appear;
* both marker phrases are present, so a client is told what exists *and* how to
  choose;
* a config that cannot be read does not stop the server from starting. The
  instructions are advisory; the tools report the config error themselves, with
  the remedy. This is the branch that must never raise.
