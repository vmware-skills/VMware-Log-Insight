"""Session-wide sandbox: the suite must not touch the operator's real files.

Installed at *import* time, not in a fixture: a fixture runs after collection
has imported every test module and, with them, the package — too late to move
a path something already resolved.

``OPS_HOME`` moves ``vmware_policy``'s shared ``audit.db`` (and the policy,
budget and undo state beside it). ``HOME`` moves anything resolved
from ``~``.

This repo got the sandbox on 2026-09-11, when a sibling (VMware-VDI) was found
writing test rows into the operator's real ``~/.vmware/audit.db`` because it
had none. This suite was not leaking — no test calls an ``@vmware_tool`` function end to end yet — but that was a property of which
tests exist today, not a protection. See
``tests/eval/regression/test_audit_isolation.py``.
